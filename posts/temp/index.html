<h2 id="shower-thoughts">Shower thoughts (praise for the passionless)</h2>
<hr>
<p>On the road, I have stopped asking my hosts how to make the shower work, i.e. which ways to turn the
knobs to ideal temperature, do I leave the metal bead string alone to dangle, or discovering the
deformed zucchini shaped handle pulls in two dimensions instead of one. I have stopped asking since I
am normally a burden to begin with in my scattered, overextended behavior.</p>
<p>I am often uninvited, though welcome, and have delicately weaned an afterthought of invitation by
swearing on my low-maintenance. yo, hey, im a fly on the wall! My hair is healthy to spite the circus of
store brands and household favorites that gloss through it (fingers always crossed I put the bottles back
facing the right way to leave no trace). Today, it does not spite the chlorine, instead cowers like a
weeping willow bends, a crack along its spine. Phone buzzes after shower. Phone to ear, k‚Äôs voice
elevates as I disclose my timeline for job training in india. He is going to Australia, the same time, for job training.</p>
<p>I sleep with chlorine in my bleached hair until the color turned wretched and blistering. Next time I stand in
the mirror, I am staying at p‚Äôs house which knows the beauty and convenience of central air, and I stand
below a vent in the guest room. The cold gusts thin out before me to cover the room, like a disarray of a
thousand little feathers dissolving to a thousand
little pockets of air. Beneath skin, my insides are hot and boiling over. I smile, the cyclothymic manic
still uninspired, still onsetting to peak this season of the year and every other and I smile, hard.</p>
<p>The boldness which is uncontained, never goes unquestioned. By habit, I think into existence the
very lack I feel. like depression smokes a friend‚Äôs cigarette for the sensation of paper
against tongue. When I turn a corner in a familiar place I wish what I saw was completely foreign.</p>
<p><strong>A YEAR EARLIER in 2018</strong> k and i are driving up the Bay and through silicon valley after I show up uninvited&hellip;and I
say, ‚ÄúI think I am going to drop my American studies major. But I don‚Äôt see myself living here (in the
valley where all the tech is) either.‚Äù A profession, k turns his head from the wheel and the spotlight
floods shotgun. He spits his drink, if he had one I imagine, because my point is blatant: my college study
has felt meaningless.</p>
<p>We are agreeing that the money in tech makes the burnout worth it in the short run‚Äîfor him that means
the bore of the work (intellectual fizzle, the kid‚Äôs a brainiac) and for me, fizzling ethically and spiritually.
But then he starts to take very, very personal offense. American studies is YOUR thing! After 3 years of satirizing my field for its leftist and impractical lean, he‚Äôs
pushing the importance. He‚Äôs riled and his drink is spilling goddamn everywhere. How could you leave it
behind? HOW COULD YOU?</p>
<p>The awareness hits that we are whizzing down the freeway, 80 mph, like crashing down to earth on an
asteroid version of hard. Now, the offense of the curve of the roads is taken and the whipping and
lashing is personal. Out the window I cannot stitch a pattern of stable image or scenery. California. What
is it meant for something to my ‚Äòmy thing‚Äô, ‚Äòmine‚Äô, when nothing has ever felt like that in the first place. I
know it is selfish and privileged to care.. or not care at all.</p>
<p>Some months the pressure of triviality is so immense I don‚Äôt mind a bad accident. I don‚Äôt mind if our
names, whiplash, and crash were all in the same sentence, and I‚Äôm not saying we would since k is a very
good driver but I‚Äôm saying I wouldn‚Äôt mind.</p>
<p>sobered beyond sobriety and i know the triviality is speaking. I am still chewing the residue of spring.</p>
<p><em>-4 months before then -118 showers before then</em></p>
<p>By the end of my 3 years in college, I prove that I can dedicate myself to almost anything without a
second thought. Surprising friends I sign up to become (basically) an amateur
logger for another work-study. In a blizzard, I saw down invasive shrubs and miniature trees. Weeks
later it‚Äôs 90 degrees and I cough among billows of smoke as my tearing eyes give way to fire, controlled
burn on the dry, dry prairie. To surface a 50 hour
courseload, two jobs and leaking head, the mixed episode- you let the blood drip and dry. Mostly, I close off.
Some months of my life the pressure of triviality is immense and everything I‚Äôm dedicated feels
unspecial, to me.</p>
<p><em>+4 months back to then +118 showers back to then</em></p>
<p>In that car down silicon valley bathing in sobriety. the weakly linked state. Sobriety is limiting
consumption and believing the present. We‚Äôre barreling and it‚Äôs making me think of all the ways&hellip; that closing this door opens the infinity of sitting in the moment.
The ways the guilt of giving up is the guilt i&rsquo;m taught to become.
I can think of all the
ways I am so sure of this as the ‚Äòprocess‚Äô of individuation that I have never been so confident in the face of losing something + others‚Äô unbelieving in
my entire life.</p>
<p>Giving up the label ‚Äòhumanities‚Äô once I find the liberal arts is still obsessed with labels as is everywhere
else, like studying French proves youre romantic and social justice proves youre humane. I find it alright
(even permissible) to arrive empty at times, praising the passionless.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-breath-at-7000-ft">My breath at 7000 ft</h2>
<hr>
<p>Versatility. while nothing could ever be ‚Äòyours‚Äô, you turn with ease from
one thing to another. detail compels you.</p>
<p>In the dictionary we find (def) nominal: something that has almost no value and/or exists in name only;
syn. trifling and insignificant, trivial.</p>
<p>In language we possess among 200,000 words but only use a small subset to describe our possessed
lives. To millions of people, these words are known by name not experience as often the result of
education (ie the penitentiary), and to others vice versa (ie imposter syndrome).</p>
<p>Lingering on the tiny and between, there are moments where I pronounce nominal as phenomenal as
nominal back again, because surely nothing exists in name or life only and nothing lacks value, and there
I flourish. There is my ego little girl in a tidepool, for when there is no early or easy metaphor (<em>for why
is there all shades of pain and reduction</em>), I shall find one in the spirals of shells and ebbing transitions.</p>
<p>Each day the representative verb of my life will feel less like pages flipping and recycled droplets of
water tumbling down my face, in different people‚Äôs showers.</p>

<p>my breath. my breath at 7000 ft.</p>

<h2 id="working-title">Working title</h2>
<hr>
<p>there‚Äôs a comfort in diagnosis sometimes and I can let the nature take over.
But as I let the words linger I wondered how for me this idea isn‚Äôt new; hovers like dust around corners
and looks like something‚Äôs always floating there. Paradigms already in motion before those October
stars align. oct 97. At the inception of my life is the idea that depression alters materially.
depression, as more than a figment of human context or how i feel. The union of nature and nurture, the
thing my mom studied as a biopsychologist at tufts, is continued with me. I crawl out the womb and take
my first two breaths as two lives of two harvard students are taken early. The union of nature and
nurture in my family decrees that we will never know if depression is a predisposition or the
consequence of tainted environment- [collectively] does it come from the ivy league administration that
isolates its students enough to drive its students to murder and suicide. is that why I will never know my
aunt, whose murderer committed suicide, and instead must imagine her as my angel. [mom] does it
come, seasonally, from never before having seen snow, pushed out from Saigon to san diego to boston
lastly, with only half your family, apart by global politics, but not apart from your abusive dad. is that
why s.a.d. lamps, especially the one in minnesota made me hate artificial light too. [grandma] does it
come in the night as tremors and hallucination, from losing your entire personal history in a new country
and your daughter‚Äôs haunted spirit. is that why im still afraid of the dark and being left alone
for years and years and years. I demand asking why: though at days end for me nature and nurture are
muddled. Genetically we are altered by the experiences we have after we‚Äôre born (and those of our
parents before), as trauma is proven to do over years and years and years, at times instantly; only
because we could never isolate the human from science to prove we aren‚Äôt.
With information I‚Äôm a humble yet sarcastic conversationalist. I don‚Äôt claim to know anything most of the
time but run with my gut. to see if I can be convinced of a counter. When asked if suicide is an abnormal
psychology, I have no idea so I use the argument that through all of evolution an individual‚Äôs prime
motive is survival, furthering itself in biology or even artistically if its aware of its impermanence. I am a
debater. Therefore AFF., abnormal.
I make good guesses most of the time, but what do I say when my friend j reveals her sister has
attempted 3 times this summer while she was away, the guilt she feels because they‚Äôve never been
close, my friend who confides in so few people. She states it like a fact which doesn‚Äôt facilitate
response. Anything I say is no better than a blank stare. I‚Äôm sitting at the friendly toast feeling
something rise, like I don‚Äôt know if antidepressants or any kind of support and probably not involuntary
hospitalization can create the change they need in time. This has been 2 years in the making, the length
of time ive known j, but surely a decade for her and her family with relapse after relapse. At days end
I‚Äôve seen darkness as a contagion that cannot be fended alone exclusively or by others exclusively. This
fight is ceaseless for no matter what lengths j‚Äôs family goes to support the sister‚Äîand they will continue
to like they should‚Äîchange cannot happen unless the victim subscribes to the long road of trying for it.
The cold truth is the victim has to work twice as hard to (1) ask for help and (2) grasp for autonomy or</p>
<p>rewire the involuntary, especially when the affliction‚Äôs the brain. With neurological repair you need both
external and internal attribution for why you‚Äôll be above the water soon.</p>
<hr>
<p>Like I said, I make guesses most of the time but every once in awhile I will make a firm case. Not just
for the sake of convincing I mean. This is one of those times where I say exactly what I mean: the
undercurrent is I can‚Äôt stand the pop culture of mental wellness. While well-intentioned, the saturation of
media and its growth as an industry (of wellness) has turned it didactic, infamous by its worn execution.
1.alessia cara and logic releasing a song with a suicide hotline number as its title. in of itself really
impactful, raising traffic/calls by 27% in the month after the release. This, VERSUS entertainment shows
making any entertainment out of suicide and mental health and additional death (mostly looking at 13
reasons why, but there are other culprits) without addressing the topics responsibly, instead pointing to
blurbs at the end of an episode with a bunch of hotline numbers to call if you have x issue after being
triggered from watching, as ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô behavior. same infuriation goes toward any content creator or
commenter on a forum that slaps these hotline blurbs at the end of their content, and doing nothing
more, as a sad excuse for taking responsibility for whatever triggering shit you‚Äôve posted.
2. in 11th grade this guy who asked to prom one of my xc teammates ‚Äòjust for her body,‚Äô and told me so,
and tried to get me to set it up, also suggested that I start volunteering for a suicide prevention hotline
as material for my college app. he said he had been doing it for a few months and that ‚Äòtraining was
pretty chill‚Äô so there shouldn‚Äôt be a problem with me trying out even if I think I can‚Äôt do it. consider that
hotline responders may be volunteers, so unprepared for whatever is thrown at them. contrast with #1
3. mentally well white people clinging to pretty and flowery instagram mantras [cut off toxic people / no
one can make you feel inferior without your consent / treat yourself / love your flaws / do a face mask /
eat chocolate / spend / cancel all your commitments] as their surefire way to help those who are
suffering. the mental wellness industry becomes yet another instance of WEIRD psychology- Western,
Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Fashion is shirts with ‚Äòmy anxieties have anxieties‚Äô
written in cursive on them, depression and anxiety as crudely self-diagnosed and ‚Äòtrendy‚Äô. when you
think about the number of psych studies performed on American college campuses vs. not in the realm
of depression and anxiety, you start to SEE the discourse of mental wellness as a mere reflection of the
these populations with inherited sociocultural capital and involved norms [individualist, consumerist,
meritocratic], expressing a stylized sort of truth.
4. the purism or the idea that ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù or your toxic environment that you put yourself in is the root of
your unhealthiness, OR that everyone‚Äôs problem is brain chemistry, which can only be modified with
celexa Lexapro Effexor etc. this purism calls for education and listening to others experiences. binary
thinking is especially damaging to, rendering invisible the bipolar and schizophrenic communities, the
most stigmatized identities with mental health by cultural and bureaucratic measures. the most seriously
mentally ill are still neglected by circles and structures of power in the mental health industry, in favor
of lower order symptomatic disorders like generalized depression and anxiety, ADD and OCD. for the
highly symptomatic, they are often in need and always deserving of reliable care that‚Äôs both clinically
chemical + encouraging of self-awareness. for the highly symptomatic, the nuance is crucial.
5. speaking of education, the general need for empathy and sharing the weight of the world among each
other. simply attempting to learn the ropes of trauma-sensitive healing, and how to spread positivity if
you are able. if you are in a group of friends or in a family unit, take the time to check in on everyone
but go further, again if you are able‚Äîdon‚Äôt leave it all to the ‚Äòmom friend‚Äô or the cancer or the kindest</p>
<p>one or your literal mom because you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a helper type, or more frankly you are selfish
with your time. consider your limits (what‚Äôs really exhausting vs what is narcissistic) as you rush, then
hesitate to point someone towards talk therapy or a mental health professional. strengthen individual
relationships. most controversially // maybe its time to recognize that everyone needs to become mental
health proficient in a world where there‚Äôs a shortage of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô, the expertise is only quasi-successful,
and the number of afflicted individuals is growing in our overly disconnected oversaturated strikingly
paradoxical society. alike how technology has permeated every sphere and industry and tech skills will
be required out of every labor market, awareness of mental health might have to permeate every
relationship ‚Äì and maybe we all can‚Äôt help everyone in small ways and the validity of a ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô
behind mental health remains, but we can try harder to be the person who shows up.
In my personal culture, the union of nature and nurture decrees that there‚Äôll be days where you‚Äôre above
the water. There is history here of cyclical growth and respected choices. When you walk in my door I
am respected by my choices. For me I‚Äôd like your partiality to my brain, as connected to a familial,
ancestral past and individual past, but as a future which I determine regardless. When you walk in my
door you don‚Äôt tell me what I need; you listen for i cant be my own hero every time, but I have watched
the nature, celexa, and zoloft work and fail again for this family tree, rooted in gene over years and
years. you listen, so I wish for internal attribution explaining why, perhaps the wave is passing and you
help me see to it.
‚ÄúMefloquine psychosis may be distinguished from schizophrenia and certain other forms of
psychiatric illness in that it may feature prominent characteristics of dissociation,‚Äù she adds. In
other words ‚Äì patients may act with new behavior, yet see their actions as if they were watching
from outside.‚Äù
Industries of wellness are lazy, but I feel relieved. On the 28th the travel doctor says they don‚Äôt
prescribe the old generation of malaria meds anymore, the ones that trigger flutters of latent thoughts. I
float at the surface, learn to live with what‚Äôs below the water. Though I never forget my eyes are
deserving of the sky.
In the lilt of shorebreak.</p>
<p>08/31/2019 pina colada
One of the many things that fascinates me about people is that we all have these quirks that we feel are
very ‚Äòme‚Äô or very personal. But for one reason or another, we don‚Äôt care enough to share it with others
and barely factor it into our daily self-expression. They‚Äôre like harmless first-day / icebreaker facts,
except not your go-to ones.
Take my high (mental) energy. Either calloused or charmed by my escapist disposition,
my friends know it. In practice this can look like a gleam in the eye, peer pressuring
others, or planning your wedding at 15. Most in my circles have no idea that I LOVE
weddings. Quirk? I sleep in a different place every night because I‚Äôm frantic. But never,
‚ÄúI love weddings.‚Äù
For extra credit in english class, I type up a 3 page document planning my wedding
(amidst a unit on pride and prejudice). It‚Äôs a destination wedding in Australia. There
will be ~30 invitations and whoever says yes will have their travel compensated.
Catered by my favorite French-cambodian restaurant The Elephant Walk, dinner will be followed by a</p>
<p>reception with live band music. We will dance all night on the beach; I‚Äôll make circles with the dress
pictured, glitter raining down. The bridal party is everyone in unmatching attire. I will be 27.</p>
<hr>
<p>My mom believes that after your first wedding, a second one is unnecessary even if you remarry. ‚ÄúYou
already did the whole shebang once.‚Äù I‚Äôve been secretly hoping for my mom to have a second wedding,
even if there‚Äôs no official second marriage, because I love a good party and especially one that
celebrates love. ‚ÄúBut what about the fun of a party?‚Äù Resigning lately, I know it‚Äôs a long shot.
In the u.s. the divorce rate is on the decline, at 17.5 per 1000 people (1.75%) in 2010. However the
number of americans who are currently divorced still rises since couples seldom become un-divorced‚Äì
and that‚Äôs where you hear the statistic that 50% of marriages end in the u.s..
From the extent of my knowledge, my mom divorced my first step father in 2008 when the rate was
18.7/1000 (1.87%).
1.87 seems stinted. Within one of my group chats‚Äîwe make a point to celebrate little things like every
drip of pop culture tea and every holiday‚Äîwe joke on a Sunday in June that no one‚Äôs said
HAPPY FATHER‚ÄôS DAY:
p‚Äôs dad I don‚Äôt know too much about, except that he was/is an alcoholic and can‚Äôt take care of much
besides chickens.
t‚Äôs similarly, though he drove me and t home once and seemed fine, but then I heard otherwise.
m‚Äôs dad is gone in a different sense, rarely ever going into it.
f‚Äôs dad is complacent and the mom a raging, also alcoholic, in many ways abusive bitch. I don‚Äôt know
which is worse, honestly, as media normalized the roles reversed.
in s‚Äôs house I‚Äôve always tiptoed because the caring of his words morphs to lethality in my mind.
something I would never say out loud, I try to separate s from that kind of rage.
w I have known for too long. w‚Äôs hurt hurts me too. twice, the cellular guy comes knocking and asking
for whoever pays the phone bill. w and w‚Äôs brother answer two separate times, giving two different
answers for what day of the week dad will show. ‚Äúoh, so you got a weekend dad too?‚Äù cellular guy gets
it, the hurt of a relationship that cannot age well.</p>
<hr>
<p>g is the one we might be jealous of, or at least secretly thinking is so lucky. At times I stop to remember
that it is easy for no one. when they came out dad said I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre pink or purple or blue..
which sounds like the chaste optimism of love, simon , might be good enough for g, and yet I know how
much of yourself you can still hide in the light, at a half revelation.</p>
<hr>
<p>With each year of your life that passes by, you either become more like your parents or less so. They
say as truism that every young adult is afraid of becoming their parents; and yet a chunk of the
millennial-genz cusp generation only really knows one biological parent. 1.87 * a span of 10 years (a
very conservative guess of 2000-2010 for the years a millennial/genz-bearing couple could have gotten
divorced) = 18.7% of our parents have gotten divorced. But this math does not account for separated,</p>
<p>widowed, and unhappily married parents which bumps up the number of kids who might hate their
parents, absent or not, from the second tenth percentile to an unknown amount, matching the qualitative
experience of this generation.
Fear of becoming cuts infinite ways. It could look like.. your strength when your mom‚Äôs heartbroken,
because the gifts dad gave you are right from five below‚Äôs checkout aisle. ‚Äúhe just doesn‚Äôt know you at
all.‚Äù It could look like.. the checkered streets you‚Äôve been groomed toward prodigy along, your uptight
parents asking what you‚Äôve been reading but rarely how you are, so how you are is you drive to planned
parenthood alone in the freedom of those checkered streets. It looks like clinginess and aversion. It
looks like learning of stoicism in the sixth grade and feeling deeply that was you, 8 in the car, by the
chinatown gate the two about to kill each other till your mom‚Äôs kicked out and headed separate ways. It
looks like wondering now if they knew how scary it looked but if they were unable to control it anyway.
It is the fear of inheriting ugliness. Holding back for at times you question if you are a deeply bad
person, and if there are truths you cannot control or escape from, in the ways we all hold back. Every
good person questions.</p>
