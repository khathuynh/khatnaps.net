				<p><em>Adapted from installment #5 of nose boop collection. In fierce belief and defense of pop culture. The whimsy of tattoos, hot girl summer, small talk which is hot, smart, and tamely grunge.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tendrils">Tendrils</h2>
<hr>
<p>The tattoo artist ends a sentence on his kids. I hang onto words like crossing lines
in optical illusions. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sitting very well,‚Äù which in tattoo speak might mean I‚Äôm
not flinching. I glance downward, rose tendrils in chemical. There are lapses among
the drilling taking shape and inside those valleys, a lantern floods the path.
The answer I am searching for is written deep within the folds of the canyonside. My
psyche lately has felt like a desert which overnight, every night, dews with frost. I
celebrate earth in the unveiling of roses, the icosahedron, and the happy molecule
with a bad rap (serotonin) on my ankle.</p>
<p>What is your deepest desire? Inner and outer peace / a compassionate world / personal
growth / platonic love / understanding other people</p>
<p>Often my legs down to my toes brim with nervous energy from watching the world
through a tiny pinhole. Will you shame me for feeling this way? Will you blame my age,
my early twenties or my generation for naively believing I could be anything but
narrowed. It often seems as if there‚Äôs an expectation that we live in a purely formal
and mathematical time, e.g. there is no such thing as a side effect or irregularity in
a given situation&ndash; only the contained space of the input, transition function/rule,
and output exists as ‚Äòin scope‚Äô. that if a person or culture or corporation were
presented a given decision multiple times, it would better, IDEAL, if they performed
‚Äòconsistently‚Äô (identically) across all trials.</p>
<p>After a few ‚Äòwarmup‚Äô strokes, we aim for shorter breaks between dives of the ink pen.
Engaging meditation to reframe the pain: I collect my splintered thoughts to clot in
one place in borrowing from beginner‚Äôs yoga. Within the space between my eyes, above
the bridge of my nose and now heavy like a black hole, that is the place.</p>
<p>In this practice my ego moves into one tiny alter-galactic home. i STAY PRESENT,
attend to every room and it‚Äôs goopy mind clutter with the context that i am ONE mighty
humble SMALL DOT. Though, there is always collateral with this practice and maybe you
know what I mean by that nauseating feeling in which my soul is always poorly
translated,that i dont belong in this strict and precise world , that the best glimpse
I have of a soul beyond social construct is it‚Äôs relic shadow that won‚Äôt&ndash; can‚Äôt
survive beyond an altered state of consciousness waning away. And i am a silhouette.
For passing through meditation,trauma, psychedelics, weighted dream,and the
shock-to-skin of experience has me resolved that perhaps I don‚Äôt belong to the world,
but the world doesn‚Äôt belong to me either.</p>
<p><code>I want to touch my toes with your toes with the tendrils of roots of fungi plants</code>
in symbiotic relationships with one another until the idea of /belonging/ dissipates
forever.</p>

<h2 id="groceries">The handles of flimsy plastic grocery bags twisting down, carries my weight like I like living and leaving alone</h2>
<hr>
<p>As a college freshman I knew the feeling of that year and all its signifiers would
leave a mental residue. I just couldn‚Äôt place how it would manifest yet. And, at what
sensitivity. From then on there was no transition where I didn‚Äôt find myself at awe,
grasping at nothing while desperate for clairvoyance: as to know with certainty, what
aspects of grocery trips, grey mornings, and deep breaths would weave my memory web
for the current ‚Äòperiod,‚Äô unravelling in every fathomable direction.</p>
<p>I was reading a book (Tao Lin‚Äôs Taipei ) where the protag.‚Äôs just woken up and
convinced he‚Äôs a kid again in Florida, then a fall semester college freshman, then 25
which is his current age.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe felt dimly excited&hellip;in its mysterious approach from some eerie distance, like
someone else‚Äôs consciousness&ndash;before resolving plainly into a memory, of having
already left Florida, at some point, to attend New York University. After a deadpan
pause, during which the new information was accepted by default as recent, he casually
believed it was autumn and he was in college, and as he felt that period‚Äôs particular
gloominess he sensed a concurrent assembling, at a specific distance inside himself,
of dozens of once-intimate images, people, places, situations.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs about waking up in a stir and stuck in a past moment, about the consuming and
bodily kind of nostalgia which you can‚Äôt anticipate until you‚Äôve passed through it.</p>
<p>Why do few images stay with you fully?</p>
<p>Others, meanwhile, get flattened to a canvas of abstract textures and characteristics.
As if an art history class had a go at a period of your life, and listed out every
effect of light (negative space speaks volumes),so then into neutrinos, they broke
apart the color purple from absence. Contrast. Held up a mirror to a synthetic leafy
vine to picture it wilting then unwilting. Subversion!! Admittedly, this is where your
peers got a little carried away and maybe you too, after which a ‚Äòperformance piece‚Äô
could be engaged as periodic but random bouts of razor sharp white noise, like an old
tv being unplugged, were overlayed onto the chattering.. fabric.. of purple? By the
end of the class only three scrawls of words are circled. ‚ÄúRadioactive, lush, deep
violet.‚Äù Bell rings. As you resolve the canvas&ndash; the memory, it might point to PROFILE
OF JUNGLE ARCADE MACHINE AT CHUCKE.E. CHEESE BIRTHDAY PARTY or LOITERING AMONG SET
DESIGN OF RAVE FESTIVAL, but most likely FAMILY OUTING AT THE HALL OF FOUNTAINS AT
KOWLOON, A SPRAWLING BOSTON-AREA LANDMARK/MOCK PAGODA OFFERING KITSCHY POLYNESIAN
DECOR, MAI TAIS AND COMEDY (google maps).</p>
<p>My winter months are narrated by dives into cultural criticism.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúI try to take something, like a car commercial, and think.. is there a way to
turn this into a personality trait? The characters in my movies invent new
territory and create realities and maintain them through being in proximity to
other (sometimes incongruent) things. They don‚Äôt need the state of conditioned
otherness to exist.‚Äù (Ryan Trecartin on I-Be-Area)</li>
<li>‚ÄúArt that affects you in the moment, but which you then find hard to remember,
is straining to bring you to another level. It offers images or ideas from that
other level, that other way of being, which is why you find them hard to
remember.‚Äù (Art of Cruelty by Maggie Nelson)</li>

<h2 id="violated-by-capitalism">Violated by capitalism</h2>
<hr>
<p>I‚Äôm aware I basically got two pop culture cult tattoos in one because at once i
joined #odesza #basicbitchedm #raver club and #serontonin #mollypoppin #thehappymolecule
club, and I‚Äôm aware I feel punished for liking popular things,
that <code>liking a popular thing is indeed a modern day crime</code>,</p>
<p>And sometimes I will feel compelled to take a trip to ‚Äòreal art‚Äô by rolling my
suitcase up to the counter. Happy to have you in the Cultured Metropolis, how was your
trip here? Honestly, you really wanna know? I was reading this book to pass some time,
it‚Äôs by davis sedaris, heard of him? Yeah? yeah well let me tell you: it has left me
feeling like all art is 4.1 stars / 10. Meh. 4.1 stars because a book review with the
phrase ‚Äòcritically inspired‚Äô does in part mean servicing me bringing me somewhere new
(i like this part, i am engaged)&ndash; but also in part holding a knife up to my neck and
the knife has a cartoon angry face and unclosable speech bubble (this fatigues me). in
scribbles: ‚Äútechnocapitalism violated you!! &gt;:(‚Äù <em>No way</em>. I feign surprise. I decline
invitation to join the rebellious coalition. Art has me hostage, ready to gag me so I
don‚Äôt scream, then gasps, ‚Äú(bleep) she‚Äôs got no (bleeping) teeth!‚Äù</p>
<p>They fell out in my sleep from all the garbage im eating right up.</p>
<p>Sedaris in Calypso insists, in daily life you converse with professions, that is,
devil heart-eyes and canine teeth feeding on your carcass trodden with dollar signs&ndash;
seldom with the person behind it (paraphrase). Yet for all the bad rap and all its
adjacency to violating -isms, small talk finds me creative in desperate times. Small
talk helps me and finds me helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find people view small talk and popular culture synonymous as equally ugly and
violating.</p>
<p>Clever people moralize small talk as a climatic waste of time. Clever is hot smart and
tamely grunge, which small talk antithesizes. You know you‚Äôve first piqued someone‚Äôs
interest when they make out not your lips, but with your captive eyes, as if to say,
‚ÄúQuit small talking me,‚Äù like freshmen (and seniors after ending their long-term
relationship; a class on foucault) do on the foreground of college dorm parties.</p>
<p>Careful.</p>
<p>‚ÄòClever‚Äô people talk about ‚Äòdumbing down to turn up‚Äô to refer to electronic dance
music and tattoos.</p>
<p>What if we reframed small talk to read and speak like a third date with your next best
friend? My current career goal is to bring back the third date.</p>
<p>What if popular media were to be legitimately critiqued, and the high-brow not let off
so easily? Feeling fatigued about ARTISTS COVERING WELL WORN GROUND AND CRYING ABOUT
CAPITALISM and should i feel more shook by things they discovered but ive already
lived? <code>Capitalism may be the journey of defending yourself from violation when you find yourself attracted to capitalist things</code>, is it possible?</p>

<p>He said he liked my tattoo but I didn‚Äôt check his boxes. After my hinge prospect
dropped me because i didn‚Äôt want to have sex with him during our second date, while i
had a second-degree burn on my face, a friend prescribed me the show Sex Education. I
get that sexual compatibility is important. But right then I was holding a bag of
frozen peas to my face and wrinkling my brows and i hadnt slept for 3 days straight;
he knew this. Another validated my frustration: ‚Äòthis shit (digesting a slew of
screenshots) kind of like a job rejection tho wtf lol how tf is he 29.‚Äô</p>
<p>I met both friends a few years ago, around the time i started coming
to class with hickeys racing up my neck and collars of sweaters pulled so high their
backsides would hang lower down on my leg than the frontsides. The guy i was into then
loved to give hickeys, until one day that was warmer than others I felt it deeply
sacrificial to keep covering them up and said i hate you the next time he tried to.
That day must have been 70 degrees. I was weighing between ‚Äúyou look like you got
attacked by an animal‚Äù and the tangibility of two hours sitting in sweat, sweat
beading on my collarbones, underneath a scratchy knit pullover with two cats
dryer-warped together ying-yangly over my torso.‚ÄùMaybe, by like, a bear,‚Äù friend said
as a wave of nausea punched my gut and we approached the school building. Sweater came
on. Instinctively, and dejectedly. Dejectedly, i tried to jokingly whine I hate you,
maybe even angle flirtation with it, but I just came off as mean when you genuinely
said sorry in hoping for a different sorry.</p>
<p>Around christmastime, my childhood friend matthew turns me onto fried okra over cocktails and
the details of his most recent dating escapades. In the span of a few conversations he
turns me onto the dating scene in chicago.</p>
<p>One day in my journal I write, Joanna showed me an article about a writer who calls
off her wedding the day before and instead takes a research trip to the canary islands
to learn about the whooping crane. She finds the birds have a set of basic needs for
survival, just like she does, though hers haven‚Äôt been met for years in her past
relationship.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese were small things, and I told myself it was stupid to feel disappointed by
them. I had arrived in my thirties believing that to need things from others made you
weak. I think this is true for lots of people but I think it is especially true for
women. When men desire things they are ‚Äúpassionate.‚Äù When they feel they have not
received something they need they are ‚Äúdeprived,‚Äù or even ‚Äúemasculated,‚Äù and given
permission for all sorts of behavior. But when a woman needs she is needy. She is
meant to contain within her own self everything necessary to be happy.‚Äù</p>
<p>How i can feel outside my body this often; im writing</p>
<p>how is 1 in 4 still the statistic for campus sexual assault?</p>
<p>How many concessions have I made today?</p>
<p>‚ÄúFunny, you don&rsquo;t know the concessions that you&rsquo;re making
Until you catalog &lsquo;em
And by then they&rsquo;re many and you&rsquo;re battle-hardened‚Äù (Fire Drills by Dessa)</p>
<p>The year I was 15 i was followed home on foot and by truck i think more times than i
could count on two hands. My mom said to watch out.and that im grounded for lying
that i got a ride back at midnight when really i walked. So ive gotten used to looking
over my shoulder and when i was 16 i was at an office park in LA -where my aunt works-
reading The Scarecrow (crime thriller set in LA) in the outdoor patio lobby. A guy in
a suit came by to tell me he works for a production company a few floors up and
they‚Äôre about ready to produce a tv adaptation for the scarecrow, giving me his
business card and that was real real cool. But then i went to the mall. And this customer
sales rep on smoke break and stranger maybe danger started asking me about my ethnicity and how we should drive to
westminster to get vietnamese food, do you want me to take you there? 30 minutes pass
and 9 years a part i said im 19 i dont want to be rude and the lines get blurry but</p>
<p>sometimes i believe there is a way out</p>
<p>Hot girl summer for me is not abt femme fatale its abt feeling good and safe and smiling
all the way up to my ears, maybe going home with someone new, mostly trading out that
need to go home by myself drunk off something strong as a practice for the worst case
scenario, to know what i can handle, the twisted reality of how ive come to like this
practice because it makes me feel one step ahead of the most malicious actors.
My hot girl summer screams ventura california, dave and busters in san jose and the song sex money feelings
die coming on without a single soul cramping my space, albeit in a crappy club my mom
used to go to when she was younger, knowing i am finally..</p>
<p>SAFE IN MY OWN SKIN, if only for a moment.</p>
