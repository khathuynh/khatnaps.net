				<p><em>In winter of 2018 I took a course on theory &amp; methods in american studies, in which the final assignment was to write a reflection on my time thus far as an american studies major and begin to design the proposal for my senior thesis project. I did drop the AMST major. However I got the amazing opportunity to intern with the MBTA in the summer between my junior and senior year (the focus of my proposed research), positioning me within the intersections of tech, transportation, and social impact, as I entered the post-college world.</em></p>
<h2 id="reflection">As a scholar of american studies, what is my view of the field?</h2>
<p>I don’t think this story could be told in totality without tracing back to a classic undergraduate ritual: the waitlist email. You know how it goes. Student professes interest in said course subject by listing reasons A to Z, asserts their competence through skills acquired from previous difficult—yet engaging!—courses, and ends with a charming, “So do you think you’ll have a spot for me in the class?” As easily as these scripts can approach banality on the instructor’s end, they survive as documents of reflection for students, encapsulating enthusiasm, grievances, and worldview at a single moment in the chaotic timeline of undergrad experience.</p>
<p>So, why did <em>I</em>, a freshman with three years left on the roster, deserve an immediate seat in AMST.115: Placing Identities? I had three reasons, representative of interests I developed in high school. First and foremost, I was in love with maps. But, I didn’t just want to do cartography—I wanted something of human-centric topographies built on top of layers of politics, culture, economy, etc. and halfway through the email I settled on ‘ethnography’ as the best word for the kind of scholarship I was shoddily describing. Reason two, relatedly, rested on a deep appreciation for pop culture. Casting wide nets for scraping up sources was already my forte (so much of my teen years was spent uncovering American phenomena through pop-cultural windows like Genius-annotated lyrics, Tumblr fandoms, and engaging outside of my New England liberal niche in online communities) and I saw an inviting opportunity to do more of it. Finally, perhaps representing a true nod to the ‘American’ part of American Studies, was my preoccupation with the American Dream. I had written numerous pieces in high school on this favorite topic, wherein I argued that the Dream was alive and well for a civics essay competition, dead for American Lit., and some place in between for other purposes. I sought a better vocabulary and a larger contextual frame to further negotiate all things American.</p>
<p>Through intro, I fulfilled the many expectations and goals I had outlined in that very first waitlist email. Freshman spring blessed me with endless ethnographic studies, experimentation with citing songs and suburban sitcom Weeds in scholarly work, and new concepts to wrestle like citizen production and Lauren Berlant’s ‘cruel optimism.’ I’d be lying if I said that the term was anything short of a true boon. Yet, a class is no fun if you come out the other side only having learned what you had expected to learn.</p>
<p>“The elite-tified city, the inner city, the suburb, and the rural all elicit images, as well as supposed socioanthropological ideas, that struggle to align with my experience of American place. The soundscapes of constant drug busts outside my complex and of conversation about $300 prom dresses with my classmates do not coexist well. Instead, they foster a divisive mentality. One that requires a set of coordinates on a necklace to quantifiably ground self-contesting notions of place and identity.”</p>
<p>These are the final sentences of my first assignment in AMST. I was soon to realize that only a tiny slice of the American landscape can be encompassed by reductive binaries. Early reliance on frames such as urban opposed to suburban and gentrified versus poor marked my naivety in the field, and through the intro curriculum I began to complicate, ontologically, the very notion of stringent categories—turning a skeptic eye toward definitions has been infinitely productive in experiences to come. In discussion, I also found a place to talk about class for the first time. Long the elephant in public discourse, as implied through frustrations expressed in my personal essay, class-consciousness assumed a critical role in the AMST classroom for which I was eternally grateful. I can say with confidence that I left intro with the glow of expanded horizons and newfound understanding of American experience emplaced.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most memorable intro moment, one that continues to stay with me, was classmate Maya Okamoto’s assertion in discussion: <code>“I cannot divorce emotion from academia.”</code> As I’ve constructed the major, I’ve come to grasp for myself the ultimate impossibility of placing personal experience and scholarship in separate spheres. Undoubtedly, the centering of space, place, dreams, and class in my cut of the field has been the product of a background defined at once by limitation and mobility. What I mean by this is that I grew up in a no-car welfared single mother household, and came to understand the world distinctly through a spatial lens—in riding public transit and finding adventure, as well as frustration, in moving through a diversity of spaces. It’s really no wonder, then, that I gravitate toward a sense of grounding in material reality when engaging in AMST work. Just as well as I know the social-spatial divisions of my hometown, I know that on a fundamentally physical level, people cannot build bridges and be actors of empathy if they are not able to see ‘eye to eye’ in the same planes of space. For me, AMST scholarship starts with the environmental, and often, the segregated.</p>
<p>Maps are like a source of liberation, allowing the physical freedoms of moving from place to place; but in the scholarly world, they can also give a bird’s eye view on patterns of disenfranchisement and marginalization. Past intro and through the major, I’ve identified a host of factors that construct the spaces I study. The common trap of activism I have not fully escaped but am making strides to see past: that the facets of my identity by which I feel the ‘most’ oppressed also shape my understanding of others’ sources of oppression and the focal points of my civic engagement. In addition to my initial touchstones of race, class, and pop culture, I’ve brought gender, sexual orientation, citizenship status, mental health, and diversity of experience across nonwhite racial identities to my topographical worldview beyond intro. Recently, in U.S. Women’s History, I’ve developed a much better handle on the intersectionality of feminist movements through sources highlighting the negotiations of Black welfare mothers, Asian-American female liminality, and Chicana-first feminism. I am so glad to have been exposed to these lines of thought, for helping me see the realities and pertinence of en-gendering space.</p>
<p>Another blind spot I’ve push to overcome is a distaste for theory, albeit this is still a work in progress. Likely due to a practical, “I-want-to-fix-everything-on-the-ground” orientation that comes out of my Computer Science major, this aversion has thankfully lost some of its leverage in my AMST work. In particular, AMST.345 and <em>A User’s Guide</em> are illuminating for me the many uses of theoretical frames in emplaced practice. Across Foucault’s spontaneous power, Scott’s hidden transcripts, Angela Davis’s carceral imaginary, and Gramsci’s cultural hegemony, I can derive from maps a rich tool for theory-informed modes of analysis, i.e understanding the operation of power and ideology at large and seeing past dominant narratives. Take a map interrogating the Malcom X-era industry of zoot suit production, for example, in which plotting the circulation of goods from factory to middle man to black bodies could reveal a dynamic subaltern (hidden) transcript. Or consider one of California prisons juxtaposed with the homes of the incarcerated that would instantaneously unveil the very real ‘imaginary’ of America’s carceral state. Last musing: a word map of the states created from Google autofill suggestions for “Why are [residents of the state] so…” exists and speaks directly to use of language in the production of cultural hegemony.</p>
<p>As I am inevitably dabbling in the world of ‘Medium to Big Data’ through a fondness for mapmaking, the questions of ethics and empathy surface. We have debated this to a tee in Susannah Ottaway’s digital-humanities museum curation course. At some point I will be asked, “Does reducing community centers, human beings, and whatever else you are mapping to dots and lines distance you from the subjects at hand?” No, not for me. Maps, I think, strike a wondrous balance between using data and a humanizing perspective to advantage, wherein my ideal interdisciplinary approach can truly come to fruition. In my personal experience, they materialize and literalize—ground things in reality in ways that other representational forms cannot. Maps will continue to empower me as a scholar in AMST, CS, and the spaces in between.</p>
<p>If I had to choose an overarching inspiration in terms of AMST scholarship, she would be Rebecca Solnit. I first was struck by her characterization of San Francisco as ever-changing on the Visions of California off-campus study program: <code>“imagine the place as a deck of cards constantly being reshuffled into royal flushes and losing hands, where we play poker with memory and identity and meaning and possibility, which are not quite four of a kind.”</code> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In her landmark collection of essay-annotated, personally curated maps for San Francisco and New York, Solnit redefines ‘atlas’ in upholding a view of space that is humanistic, dynamic, and inherently semantic through layers. One Solnit map representative of this philosophy is titled “Monarchs and Queens,” in which she marries the butterfly habitats and queer public spaces of S.F. in space–and there are many more pieces like this. In a scholar’s lens, I admire her ability to pull together a variety of sources to draw a larger creative picture, while still remaining sensitive to the individuality of texts. I hope to follow in the trails of this model of scholarship, and one day soon put my own spin on it.
As a cohesive experience, my adventures in AMST have so far revolved around my faith in maps for knowledge production, as well as an interest in balancing data-driven approaches and the embrace of humanism, individuality, and intersectionality. I’ve identified some scholars I admire and have gotten my own unique methodology at a comfortable place. I think I am capable of bringing something refreshing and productive to the AMST table in reflection of the ways my adventures have shaped me. Though, at this point, I envision an end game in urban planning, I am not looking to shut myself off into some remote academic sphere. I know that I still have room to grow, or, at least a few more waitlists to join in this wacky wonderful world of AMST.</p>
<h2 id="thesis-design">Designing my senior thesis proposal</h2>
<p>As I started to brainstorm ideas for a potential American Studies research project, I knew that I wanted to keep my project embedded in the local, the thematic stream of space and place, and the conversation of ‘public goods’. I quickly zeroed in on Boston’s transit agency and the backbone of my adolescent mobility, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), as the nexus of my project.</p>
<p>Out of all of the intra-city modes in the system, I am the least familiar with the Silver Line which is often included on maps depicting the rail lines of the MBTA. As a bus rapid transit service (BRT) installed in 2002 to serve the Roxbury neighborhood and corridor, it is not actually a rail line and has been a source of confusion for many T riders. Of the Silver Line, one casual blogger wrote in perplexity, “Then I saw it driving around. Above ground… I was astonished to discover that the “Silver Line” is, in fact, a bus. A bus! But Boston has a whole different map for busses; so why is it on the train map?!”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> My own experiences with the line have been minimal, but add to its air of mystery. The summer entering high school, I was part of a YMCA program aiming to expose youth to the healthcare profession, and many of the medical offices we visited were along the Silver Line. I noticed fairly quickly that a majority of the riders were black and Latinx, and that the buses were crowded even during off-peak hours. After a short run dredging up what the Internet thinks of the Silver Line, I discovered accounts expressing dissatisfaction with the line across multiple social platforms, and, unexpectedly in the same go, identified a few studies highlighting the transport sector’s own frustrations with the line’s BRT status.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Coupling these findings of severe public criticism and my understanding of Roxbury’s demography, I believe it would be a creative and useful move to center my project around an investigation of the Silver Line. I have further questions I want to provoke concerning the role the MBTA has played in issues of transportation justice, using the history and current operation of the Silver Line as a starting point for research.</p>
<p>The central question driving my project design is as follows: What is the nature of the relationship between the MBTA and the segregated spaces of Boston? Historically, as an initial investigation of the Silver Line will begin to answer, has the MBTA constructed new spatial inequities or simply reflected existing inequities in attempting to serve particular communities? These two related questions will be posed in a local context and then extended to the national sphere to one, contextualize the MBTA’s policy within the actions and identified standards of the American transportation industry at large, and two, broaden the scope of the project as a work of American Studies scholarship. With the issue of Boston’s Silver Line at its center, the project’s ambitious aim is to assess the MBTA’s take on transportation justice through local, industry-informed, theoretical, and historiographical lenses.</p>

<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>To structure the necessary research process of my project, I look to four main categories from which to draw sources and move swiftly from text to theory in terms of methodological registers. As I begin building my archive of relevant sources, the first thing I will want to focus on is <strong>local context</strong>. Since a central piece of my project is essentially a case study of the Silver Line, overlaying the histories of Boston’s inner-city planning, suburban growth, early streetcar tycoons, and later transport development becomes crucial. In addition, the MBTA’s own institutional history is publicly accessible and will likely enrich my developing understanding of the Silver Line’s local context. In parallel, a second category of sources forms around <strong>industry literature</strong> to situate the project in the worlds of genre-building and formation. A wealth of documents have been published by transport professionals on transportation equity in practice, BRT, mode analysis, and case studies of particular agencies. These kinds of sources will be infinitely useful in helping me contextualize the MBTA’s policy history within standard frameworks surrounding transportation justice and engage in comparative study. My third category for sources, <strong>mapping</strong>, then, reflects my own method of meaning-making as a scholar and specific interest in formations; as my data-driven skillsets will allow me to read MBTA policy against changes in demography in a unique and productive manner. One step past formation and composing my last research category, <strong>historiography and theory</strong> on urban planning, human geography, and related fields bring together a myriad of high-level perspectives to apply to my Silver Line study. This body of scholarship, in dealing with the abstract concepts of power, space, state, and disenfranchisement, will effectively ground my work—which, admittedly, may at times resemble an ethnographic approach—in the distinct realm of American Studies. Collectively, the elements making up my schematic for future research encourages me to visualize what information needs to be learned and analyzed in order to answer my central questions fully.</p>
<h3 id="an-archive-on-local-context-bostons-transport-centric-history">An archive on local context: Boston’s transport-centric history</h3>
<p>To start building a solid archive of sources relevant to the operation and community impact of the Silver Line, I backpedal in time to recall my first reading of Kenneth Jackson’s <em>Crabgrass Frontier</em> in AMST.115. It is a piece of secondary scholarship that explicitly references the linked, almost inseparable histories of streetcar (West End Railway) and suburban development in the Boston area. Through <em>Crabgrass Frontier</em>, I understand the notion of transport-centric development as a feature unique to Boston’s history, and thus position the book and its content as an effective starting place to procure sources addressing local context.</p>
<p>As I come to uncover documents and scholarship on Boston’s transportation and general development, it seems that I will be engaging primarily with two veins of local history: one concerning the rise of streetcar suburbs and the other complicating Roxbury’s incorporation in the streetcar narrative. Regarding the first historical slant and in effect, towns like Newton, Brookline, Medford, and Arlington, I have a number of scholarly sources that explain the essential role of private streetcar companies in driving suburban growth around Boston proper—two are Henry Binford’s <em>The First Suburbs: Residential Communities on the Boston Periphery, 1815-1860</em> and Sam Bass Warner’s <em>Streetcar Suburbs: The Process of Growth in Boston, 1870–1900</em>. Supplementing scholarship, there are primary sources, namely surviving documents the cities have published on their own histories or old newspaper articles reporting the latest of transit news across a few suburban communities. To address the neighborhood of Roxbury and the mystery around its early inclusion in streetcar development, I gravitate toward pieces on the history of Roxbury itself and its recent demographic changes. <em>Streets of Hope: The Fall and Rise of an Urban Neighborhood</em>, a monograph on the community development history of Roxbury by Peter Medoff and Holly Sklar, is a key reading. U.S. Census data would also be helpful here.</p>
<p>I build up the historical mosaic described above in order to further understand the complex evolution of the Silver Line and specifically, the puzzling event in which the elevated rail portion of the original Orange Line, preceding the Silver Line, was destroyed. Very much absent from contemporary criticism of the Silver Line is the fact that a rail line constructed as part of the founding nineteenth century West End Railway once served the Roxbury corridor, virtually mimicking Silver Line service today. Between the years of 1988 and 2002, the community experienced the lack of reliable high-speed transit service as the old Orange Line was torn down and the MBTA initiated studies on replacement services.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> My questions are: what prompted the closure of the old Orange Line, how did studies identify BRT as an effective solution for the Roxbury community, and why did it take the MBTA fourteen years to address this gap in service? Ultimately, in addition to broader historical contexts, I will need to familiarize with the institutional and policy history of the MBTA itself—articulated through Jonathan Belcher’s <em>Changes to Transit Service in the MBTA district 1964-2017</em> and other documents housed by various planning agencies—to address these questions. Histories of community development organizations in Roxbury, such as Alternatives for Community and Environment and the Dudley Street Initiative, too, can be placed in parallel or juxtaposition to the MBTA’s own histories, as to arrive at meaningful answers with multiple local perspectives considered.</p>
<h3 id="a-creative-tool-mapping-formations">A creative tool: mapping formations</h3>
<p>With an archive starting to form on local changes in demography and in the MBTA’s service through history, I’d be interested in using mapping techniques to understand my sources as a collective and as informed by larger formations. In particular, unpacking the policy history regarding the destruction of the old Orange Line could be greatly aided by spatial analysis. U.S. Census data, data on municipal incorporation, and former maps of the MBTA, West End Railway, and Boston Elevated Railway mapped in overlay fashion would paint a larger formative picture in which to interpret local context.</p>
<p>In addition to the more traditional mapping approach described above, I believe this research category represents a host for creativity. What I mean is: maps often reveal unexpected patterns. In the style of Rebecca Solnit, the maps I produce will follow her tradition of juxtaposing seemingly unrelated elements to bring new connections to light. Some elements I’d like to map in relation to transit include pollution levels or vegetation spread, unoccupied buildings, food co-ops, and community organization locations. I’d turn to the mission statements of community organizations, many of which center an environmental focus, as well as the issues of mixed use and business in development, to inspire a more comprehensive list of provocative elements.</p>
<h3 id="industry-literature-historiography-and-theory">Industry literature, historiography and theory</h3>
<p>To continue building my project around formations, and eventually, theoretical frames, industry literature, as well as historiography and theory on American transportation is essential. First, I’ll tackle the importance of industry literature. The main insight that trade professionals can provide concerns the consistency of the MBTA’s policy with industry standards. Namely, how has the MBTA applied (or not applied) nationwide practices on transportation justice and equity assessment? The <em>Community Impact Assessment and Environmental Justice for Transit Agencies: A Reference</em>, published by the Federal Transit Administration is one example of literature that would give industry context to the MBTA’s relationship with transportation justice. Relatedly, case studies of other agencies’ equity policies are widely available, ranging from investigations on Oakland’s BART to discriminatory bus funding in LA; and they embody a comparative perspective in enriching my assessment of the Silver Line decision. Regarding the Silver Line’s categorization as BRT, too, literature on BRT effectiveness and qualification is the final industry piece relevant to my project—especially as I’ve found acknowledgement that BRT in America has largely failed qualifications and become a discriminatory practice against underserved communities.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>By bringing in comparative studies and broader industry literature, I will inevitably run into the problem of variations across local contexts. Here, theory on urban planning and human geography, as well as historiography on transportation justice in the U.S. will be infinitely useful in helping me explain the single case of the Silver Line within overarching patterns and conceptual frames. Although there is certainly more to delve through in this category, I’ve identified a few key concepts and scholarship to construct my larger frames: spatial and modal mismatch (e.g. William Wilson’s <em>The Truly Disadvantaged : The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy</em>), models of political power affecting transit policy (Whitt Allen’s <em>Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power</em>), and considerations of the ‘public’ nature of public transit (Michael Manville’s <em>Why do voters support public transportation? Public choices and private behavior</em>). Evidently, I will be drawing heavily from Foucault’s ideas on power structures and Angela Davis’s notion of the political state to inform my project theoretically.</p>

<h2 id="heading-3"></h2>
<h2 id="goals-and-significance">Down the line: goals and significance</h2>
<p>Tying it all together—local context, mapping, industry literature, historiography, and theory—my project will aim to achieve three goals.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I will address my central question and qualify the MBTA’s role in shaping the richly storied neighborhood of Roxbury, whether it is one of construction or reflection of segregated spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will situate the Silver Line in a larger discussion of transportation inequity in the U.S. to characterize the MBTA as an outlier or participant of the related historiography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within sight lines, I will take my initial Silver Line study to begin thinking on the problems of using BRT to address the needs of underserved communities. Ideally, in the conclusion of the project, I’m inspired to address the issue: how do we design reliable, resilient transit that massages the limitations of the built environment and histories of segregation, to build what is equitable for all?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ultimate significance of my project lies in the Roxbury community and its progessive activism. Moving forward, my priorities are to find out what Roxbury residents think would help their community the most concerning transit, and then to influence relevant decision flows accordingly. In situating my work in the realm of activism, I am motivated to go beyond my central question. Through future projects and my own work experiences in the sector, I seek to better grasp the fund allocation and policy practices of the MBTA, as to make community uplift an agency priority and to help people understand the role of transportation as an institution that can both empower and disenfranchise communities. Schools, voting rights, welfare, and other public services have been widely recognized as grounds for social change, and I want Boston-based organizers and community members alike to put transit on the list too—essentially so as discussions of agency privatization are on the docket.</p>

<p>As suggested to me by a classmate, this two-hour educational tour follows the history of
environmental racism and classism that has impacted the Roxbury community, where “the children asthma hospitalization rate is nearly six times higher than the state average.” Since this tour centralizes transportation as an environmental justice issue through its major stop at Dudley Square Station (the terminus of the Silver Line), it is an essential source for understanding the local overlaps between transportation and equity in the Silver Line area.</p>

<p>This 352-page document I found linked through the MBTA website is a compilation of various policy documents that illuminate the MBTA’s policy history, particularly during the period in which the old southern elevated subway Orange Line was replaced with Silver Line BRT.
