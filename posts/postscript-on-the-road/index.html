				<p><em>The last of 5 essays  i wrote for an off campus study program entitled visions of california, reflecting on 3 months of living and learning on the californian road</em></p>
<p>There is a saying for travel addicts that goes something like, ‚Äúevery place you visit changes you in some shape or form.‚Äù I have a theory that I developed in eighth grade which literalizes that sentiment. As follows, see if you buy it: on a very chemical level, every place you visit becomes a physical part of you given that the molecules of the environment and of the self interact, blurring the lines between the place and placemaker. Having always felt a profound connection to place, I find the theory proving true again and again. I love maps because I can visualize this network of places I‚Äôve been and associated memories, impacts, and visions in context of one another; I can see my whole life, in chemical and color, unravelling in an instance.</p>
<p>I look at a map of California and despite my East Coast roots, I cannot deny that I have been significantly shaped by the state. Never visiting more than twice a year but always finding a way back to my second home, I feel as though I‚Äôve spent a quarter of my life in California, or at least a quarter thinking about it. My mom grew up in San Diego, my ex-step-father lived in Sacramento, my American Dreamer of an aunt is making her life‚Äôs worth in L.A., and I have graced a number of cities in between. Now, I am on this trip, which is supposed to highlight the academic perspective of California experience. Yet I have found that it has been very emotional for me‚Äîit has been nostalgic, challenging, and transformative. I have been coming back to the old places deep in the recesses of my memory, sometimes painfully overwriting what‚Äôs forgotten or gone, witnessing gradual change in places I routinely visit, and taking in new places wondering if I will ever return. I wouldn‚Äôt trade this for anything, though. My map of California is now more meaningful than ever before as I face my personal juxtapositions in understanding of past and future, the American Dream, and individual impact, all the things I really struggle with at nineteen.</p>
<p>The first leg of the trip in Northern California was a lot for me to handle because I was coming from a difficult break that had ended in swollen-eyed tears.  It occurred to me on that evening of January second that since my high school graduation, I‚Äôve been chasing retail jobs, internships, externships, leadership positions, and building my credentials, whilst I call my mom only to talk about financial aid and my three-year old brother forgets who I am. I sleep in my bed at home maybe forty days a year. And so, on the way to the airport that night, I was leaving my family again and hating myself for it, because why did I always have to choose the Dream, individual fulfilment, over kinship? Arriving in SMF and later staying in Sacramento only intensified my self-dissatisfaction. Vague kindergarten memories of my ex-step-father showing me around ‚Äúthe best city in California,‚Äù maybe in Larkspur Landing‚Äôs part of town, and months later being sent to fight in Iraq reminded me that time does not stop for anyone, even family. The Dream felt like it was tearing me apart, forcing me to pick between my past and future, much like in the narratives of the Donner Party, Gold Rush optimists, and the Joads.</p>
<p>While my faith in the Dream was dying, or rather my ability to subscribe to it without undermining my roots, my general mindfulness was blossoming. Truly, California landscape is beautiful and I can understand why most people are drawn to it, almost with religious fervor. Seeing the monumentality of Northern California nature in the flesh was particularly centering, especially after encountering John Muir‚Äôs journals, Native American accounts, and the LaPenas. By the time we were perched in Redding looking up at Mount Shasta, Northern California had turned me into the environmentalist I never thought I‚Äôd be. I was making sense of my world through the inevitabilities, cycles, and equilibriums of nature, and all I needed in my approach was a little more mindful balance and less juxtaposing conflict.</p>
<p>The central coast and Bay Area was, in contrast, pretty much a blank slate for me in terms of my map, and I welcomed that with full optimism. In these new parts, I got the chance to fill my spatial memories with negotiations of racial, gender, and socioeconomic identity in contemplating Cannery Row, China Men, Pocho, Zoot Suit, the high-end cuisine industry, the sixties counterculture movement, and historical events on Angel Island. This was all beautifully coincidental as a marriage of time, space, and ideas. I have recently just started thinking about such social factors and intersectionality upon entering college, and what better place to develop my American Studies background than in the geographic middle of a highly, if not the political state of the nation? In attending an anti-Trump pro-immigrant rally in San Francisco, I really saw the potential of political activism unveil, despite my view of social media-based and millennial activism as ‚Äúmostly talk and no action.‚Äù The rally, in addition to the works we encountered providing social commentary, boosted my hopes in the influence and longevity of individual impact on public policies.</p>
<p>Southern California, specifically Los Angeles is what I know best, a mass of thirty-odd suburbs trying to call itself a city and the topographical love of my life. This leg of the trip has been familiar and in ways comforting. I walk Third Street Promenade like I own it, prix-fix my way through West Side fusion tapas restaurants for kicks, and feel alive caught up in the freeways at night‚ÄîI am Jenny‚Äôs worst nightmare straight out of gentrification. But, this is not to say I have not had my fair share of dissonance and even disturbance in regards to the L.A. lifestyle and its disillusions. In reading The Day of the Locust, The Big Sleep, and Parable of the Sower, I realize where the L.A. of some of my favorite music comes from. That is, the L.A. of the Red Hot Chili Peppers‚Äô ‚ÄúCalifornication,‚Äù Lana del Rey‚Äôs ‚ÄúHigh on the Beach,‚Äù and other tracks of the dystopian California genre. Although I have always been aware of L.A.‚Äôs notorious game of appearance‚Äìin fact, the first time I visited L.A. in 2002, I could not help but amplify in my five-year old mind the fact that all the houses looked the same (Pasadena) and that the polluted sky had a dirty orange tint‚ÄîI had never seen the trope explored explicitly in writing and with such nuance. I have to admit that the literature makes me a little uneasy about thinking of L.A. as my favorite West Coast city.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I am worried for my aunt and her getting swept up by the L.A. that mirrors a city on fire. As the person who took care of infant me while my mom, her sister, took on three jobs to make ends meet, I care a lot about my aunt‚Äôs wellbeing. She has only been a L.A. resident for four years, and already I have seen her permanently switch to a high-veggie, no-spice diet (she‚Äôs the biggest foodie I know), throw out Christmas lights because they are ‚Äútackier‚Äù than the neighbors‚Äô, make familial sacrifices for her job, and strain in her marriage, striving for more and more and then what? It‚Äôs absolutely disturbing that I can see the stereotype of the L.A. effect dramatized in literature and film influence her so personally, always one glimpse a year. Indeed, the influence is so strong that my mom and aunt do not talk based on ideological differences; they have vastly different approaches to the American Dream that I juggle. As for L.A. itself, I am not sure not how my map will evolve from here but I am praying it doesn‚Äôt mimic fiction and head towards disaster.</p>
<p>En route to the final destinations, ‚ÄúCalifornia, here we come‚Äù and here we go. I am still learning to come to terms with the past and future, my mitigation of the cruel optimism of the American Dream, and what I will do as an individual to sustain myself but also be impactful. Above all, I am happy to be learning and making my map of love and life. Thank you, California, for another unforgettable experience; you have left a mark on me.</p>
<p>XOXO.</p>
