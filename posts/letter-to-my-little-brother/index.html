				<p><em>Installment #6 of nose boop collection. 16 years older than you, I never knew what to wish on a birthday cake. And then you came without any wishing at all. Forever, I&rsquo;ll protect you with my life and all I know. Happy international women&rsquo;s month.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="grow-into">Brother, what kind of world will you grow into?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Childhood comes as it goes. Going are the dog days which I now perceive as flashes, as the first bite down on bubblegum where sparks fly and corrode to chemtrails in the mind‚Äôs eye. The textures of times. Sparks on the slide. The slow, momentary eclipse of youth commands me to let it go.</p>
<p>To my brother I concede my nights of restful sleep, the kind of sleep where I would flicker down and dream without trying at all, without the screaming in my head from infinite directions to toss me back and forth, of licking cheeto dust off my fingers without a care in the world on factories. My brother advances that world as I concede. I concede the novelty of bunk beds and baby teeth to lose and hiding behind beanstalks for legs. God, i beg you to make me short enough for monkey bars again.</p>
<p>AND YET - we are on separate sides of something I cannot quite place but is what everyone at The New Yorker wants to write a memoir on. He is growing tall in a brave new reality which is not made from the soot and ash of my concessions. There is a rift between us. Carving canyons as that tablet follows him to the dinner table, to bed and the in between.</p>
<p>He will watch a video on the solar system as we are eating and won‚Äôt even notice that I stole a chicken nugget of his, right under his nose. Until he does, and I realize I‚Äôm no less absent minded-I swear I didn‚Äôt mean to take one he already bit into- he is telling the invisible crowd the distance from Mars to Saturn in lightyears, looks up a second to forgive my mistake. My brother and I are 16 years apart and every interaction escapes me. That a 5 year old can tame the wild of the internet, can be bored by it, that he can hit the arcade jackpot at Chuck E Cheese with his jaded 21 year old sister high on a gravity bong and dreaming of a post-capitalist world is weird and uncanny and maybe even uncalled for in the books he will read (or not) on evolution.</p>
<p>Death to the encylopedia is a suckerpunch to my gut. After 16 years you robbed me of my only child status and sadness. I feel old by association, as if people my age are the last to know what we‚Äôre leaving behind, and that is life without a googleplex of demands on our attention. All old news by your time: the careful cynic says you&rsquo;ll come of age on the pandemic, cusping on technocapitalism and the violent surveillant state knocking at your door like.. Your order has arrived :-)! And you, my brother - faces his time. OS agnostic, attention deficit, naked in his knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Technology bad World bad</em> but. I‚Äôm. bad. too. And not just because I&rsquo;m a software consultant. Because sometimes creativity and connection feels like a distant memory and it‚Äôs all my fault. I build walls with black mirrors, and for whom to climb?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="did-i-create">Brother, what kind of world did I create?</h2>
<hr>
<p>On New Year‚Äôs Eve there is a sharp, sudden pain beneath the still surface, a macrodose of nostalgic every-yearness of dreading the ball drop which, when televised, ripples the strike of twelve across the eastern seaboard. Even still I farce a smile for this is the beloved tradition my childhood friends believe in. I dread the turn and I am left with the diminuendo of Dick Clark‚Äôs countdown resetting 60 minutes back for the next timezone, then MST, then PST. Of one yellow stoplight after another. Unwilling to attend what calls for attending; I sometimes dread the very feeling of feeling, preceding affection with the unsolvable gravity of separation. Keeping it casual like a 20 whatever transplant who&rsquo;s home is the jetbridge, cool as ice.</p>
<p>Imagine a rotisserie, but instead of chicken through a pole imagine a picture calendar, dizzily churning, charred and flittering in the wind with the spin in overdrive and the whole of the machine on fire. ‚ÄúTime, it has a funny kind of violence (Dessa).‚Äù</p>
<p>Today, I tag along with my friend and his family to wish grandma a Happy New Year Dinner. She startles me as the hug‚Äôs incoming, first with a peck on the cheek and then a lively chastising for coming into her home with wet hair from the shower. Walker in hand, she shows me to her hairdryer in the bathroom and the embrace is a sweet one, an ode to sensations and elusions of family beyond ‚Äòfamily.‚Äô</p>
<p>The grandmother of my friend, at 87, says, ‚ÄúI was the most lonely person in the world.‚Äù She had spent the day and night, so long, by herself on the eve of the second year of the pandemic.</p>
<p>I still believe in the wisdom of elders, though these days the kids would think that&rsquo;s backwards.</p>
<p>To be so public with your loneliness is rare. But webmd has catalogues for New Year‚Äôs depression, the day which is also my grandmother‚Äôs birthday. Privately, my -our- grandpa and grandma have recently separated after more than 25 years together. So I passively google things like ‚Äòwhat to do when grandparents divorce in your 20s lol,‚Äô and I can‚Äôt decide if that reads more pitiful and bottomless, or more so relatable if i give myself too much credit. It may be the latter, and the tired allure of condensing and technologizing one‚Äôs emotional valleys into an instagram square packet for online engagement is strong - nothing‚Äôs better than our next fix for a sad pithy tweet - but this brand of 21st century whip-smart gets me nowhere. Nowhere. We‚Äôve fought a few times in the car, hotheaded. One time he -my grandpa- was picking me up from my first job and we literally fought over the word obviously (which to him encapsulated my transformation to know-it-all teenage brat). He‚Äôs rarely right, but why I gotta act like everything‚Äôs so fucking obvious? Like nothing&rsquo;s worth saving.</p>
<p>Isn‚Äôt the gift of self-awareness the ability to take nothing too seriously as to stand squarely in the distance from performance, and do I tire of it? Yes. But. God he was so ANGRY as we revved up the hill past the BJ‚Äôs wholesale club to my house. God I feared for my life but i couldnt stop pouring fuel into the flames talking about my english teacher - ‚Äòathiest commie‚Äô- as if he were the shoes of my ideological messiah that my grandpa could not fill, and I was on fifteen on fire. Maybe taking love so unseriously, as a plaything, was the only talent I had back then; so I hold on for dear life.</p>
<p>Had it occurred to me in this conversation that in his 40s, he converted from cradle Catholicism to Buddhism to emerge as a leader in the Boston Buddhist community alongside my grandma, and that the term ‚Äòcommie‚Äô was loaded and personally repulsive because the love of his life, his newfound family, sought asylum from Vietnam.  because of communism? I did understand that I still had 25 years until 40 and there was life beyond my spheres, co-option and language as amusing. I did i did did i. There is nuance in the words we speak. I could have used a different word, but no, I‚Äôm an on trend twitter bot three steps ahead of my grandpa and his silly red scare shenanigans. With my grandpa I was four years old when an employee at Stop and Shop takes his hands off of the line of carts he‚Äôs pushing, looks at me, does a triple take, then works up the nerve to say, ‚ÄúWho is this man?‚Äù pointing to the white man in his early 50s beside me in my barely 30-pound fully Vietnamese lump of a body. ‚ÄúThat is my grandpa‚Äù and we will never have a rulebook, in every play is case by case.</p>
<p>I visit him at his house which looks lived in. They are the only set of grandparents I‚Äôve ever had (and proxy parents when my mom popped me out at 24), and what do i do with that. He informs me he has quit drinking and his friends at the local VFW legion buy him ginger beer. He talks better than he‚Äôs been in a while. We have a very serious talk about companionship. I sense he is likely in the wrong in how shit went down (in my parallel heart-to-heart with grandma she says in vinglish, the only love ill ever need is myself), redeeming with ‚Äúlove is something you work toward and we‚Äôve been together for over 20 years and so she can keep missing the calls but I‚Äôll keep calling,‚Äù and what do i do with that.. happy new year grandpa, happy birthday grandma.
&ldquo;Nobody else understand.&rdquo; She is not a widow or spinster or manic pixie dream but a woman single in her 60s is so unthinkable that she feels I am the only one in the world that could ever understand. Here‚Äôs to love and all it can look like in a stable thought.</p>
<p>~~
Like I had a single stable thought in 2020.</p>
<p>Violence. I will be quarantining with a friend at my college campus, 45 minutes south of Minneapolis, and as i happen to fly into MSP the same day George Floyd is murdered by the police i remember awful disagreements storming out and slamming the door on whether or not it‚Äôs ok for me to participate in the 2013 Black Lives Matter protests but my mom‚Äôs whole life is a goddamn refugee‚Äôs political protest arguing her ‚Äòif you dont vote you are a traitor to your country‚Äô when i was 15 yet on campus in 2020 i walk past the empty echoing buildings where i wed my intuitions in the study of america (10 students) with the computer science proofs (60 students) i never understood, i never understood five months of winter then 2 week mud season then it is lush, the greenest green i have ever seen i fear for life itself as friends and friends of friends get shot at with bullets and a semi truck full of gas hurtles toward them, peaceful protesters on the i-35 bridge and then on labor day im told to read the newspaper that a cashier at the walgreens round the corner was stabbed to death i know it is my friend because they wrote about her daughter who was her bestest friend and they would paint their nails together and olga asked me once what color to dye her kid‚Äôs hair - she‚Äôs 11 - when we first met and she checked out my bottle of wine and blue hair dye with a smile, just 1 block and one week from her memory wall i enter a sushi store where the cashier is visibly shaken, she profusely apologizes for seeming dissociated because the store just got robbed 5 minutes ago so at the DNC they can buzzword CHICAGO in november i find a colleague commits suicide as my mom is suicidal then prescribed at the expense of no appetite and weird mania in 2020 i donate to far too many funeral gofundmes and view too many online obituaries that i take an unpaid day off and go to the art institute, chicago alone: to get lost and be found by a security guard who asks me how am i feeling, within these economies of violence?, he who explains ‚Äúsome wings don‚Äôt loop.. they end in a dead end and the only way out is to trace back your steps,‚Äù so i go to what love looks like in it‚Äôs stable, material state- art splayed on the wall to assure the 1340s survived so i can only hope that we do. I can only hope what came before for you prepared you for the year. it&rsquo;s a very good sign you&rsquo;re still here to read this. I hope i&rsquo;m reachable, that by the end I&rsquo;m at least a shrivel of human to know the ways i hurt others as i am hurting, to know to startle the shame out of me to still do something about it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="show-you-mercy">Brother, will the world show you mercy?</h2>
<hr>
<p>When you leave the womb what does love look like to you? Before it looked like anything else. In your first grade journal you write, I feel loved when sister hugs me, when I spend time with my sister, a  drawing of a heart divided into four sections for snowman, beach, fried rice and sister. You send an e-card that says:
To sister
I miss you a million. You are the best! Please come home.</p>
<p>The pandemic (your 6th year of life) reveals to me a long sought clarity: a polemic on love in the wake of transgression. Society thinks it is the authority on what love is and isn‚Äôt. That tiny box around what ‚Äòreal love‚Äô looks like is so violently ingrained in me that the small lack of The Monogamous Partnered Strictly NonPlatonic Heteronormative Relationship becomes noisy&ndash;despite the fact I am in loopy love with all my varied relationships, despite swallows of love so surreal I take one look at the split in your bangs and I‚Äôm buzzing&ndash; I confuse the blissful lightness with hating myself. It‚Äôs true, sometimes I just look at you and I get lightheaded. Utter peace with&hellip; incompleteness, noisy mitigations of being that couple of that race and that social class and that sexuality and that pair of genders, et al can i throw up already.</p>
<p>One day when we grow old and our parents are gone we can trade stories endlessly, because oh do I have stories for you. Down the line I will tell you about one of the greatest romances of my life, which dawned on me as I was watching Euphoria in January, where Jules is a more than a trans teen revealing,‚ÄùAll my life, I‚Äôve been trying to conquer femininity. And somewhere along the way, I feel like femininity conquered me.‚Äù And i a cis woman live and breathe solidarity, as I hope you resonate and surpass my tries at allyship some day. I say, my greatest romance is the self. I know you‚Äôve probably heard it all before by the time you read this, all the self love megaphone talk shouting banners flashing Emotional bandwidth, Inner child, Validation. But get this, once a week at 7am i allow a 30 year old woman to finger me for half an hour, with lube because it‚Äôs 7 in the freakin morning. I‚Äôm blabbing about An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green as she matches her breath with mine in physical therapy treatment for hypertonic pelvic floors, like TMJ but instead of jaws it‚Äôs in the vagina.</p>
<p>Nodding along, I‚Äôll know your silence is your best tries at understanding what you could never, imagining what it‚Äôs really like to go to the gynecologist and be told, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have vaginismus:‚Äù a condition where the vaginal muscles involuntarily spasm at the opening and clench like a clam about to be shucked alive. For the condition is elusive and underresearched with diagnosistics stuck in the 90s, I was asked if I had a boyfriend to determine if I was sexually active (?? what about casual dating? lgbtqa?) and did not respond traumatically to generic taps of the inner thigh, so therefore do not have vaginismus. Thank god for the internet though - On Reddit thread /vaginismus I find there are folks entangled in the physiology and psychology, exploring the cross sections of natural hypertension of pelvic floor, previous successful but painful penetration, high stress levels, smaller anatomy, post-traumatic, all things which make me feel like the loneliest person in this world.</p>
<p>Your liberal radicality is fueled by approximations but try to imagine what it‚Äôs like to hold your breath for 22 years, and then to watch your belly balloon as big as hot air. I‚Äôm a shoulder breather, a girl who defers even the slightest discomfort from mind down to body, so you can only imagine how an addictive, intrusive thought cresting mental mountains might C4 to life.</p>
<p>Like you, I struggle to feel at ease in my body; like the shock of an ending, I sometimes don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm breathing at all.</p>
<p>Growing up. Tight hips. Panic attacks, in intimacy. Guarding - the sensation that I can‚Äôt move a muscle, legs shaking. Not normal.</p>
<p>From my vomit phobia I learned a lot on how to deal with other pervasions; mostly I know well I come from places of freeze and fawn. When our brains break, this is what many do. On planes, boats, cars and trains I can‚Äôt think straight without really knowing why because my phobic thought patterns are hidden scripts, so silent and ingrained in the fabric of my being that I rarely even notice it‚Äôs there. Alarms of young kids + cheeto bags = vomit eldery on accordion trolley = vomit someone coughing behind me = everything = vomit. But over the years (many, many years) I‚Äôve improved at managing this phobia: the observer in me is overtaking the actor, is all. I tell myself, just throw a line out, little miss actress is ready for her big break! And oh, she&rsquo;s incredible. Throw out a line like oh my god i could throw up this song&rsquo;s so cheesy :-)! In sex and intimacy which I guess is the biggest fricking deal of your 20s, this inner nudge tells me, <em>communicate what you need to feel safe, and try to have some fun with it</em>.</p>
<p>Do you get it? Even you, brother, are a prototype of heteromasculine fantasies. Good thing you‚Äôve got an older sister who will protect you with her life, to mean she won‚Äôt put up with your complacent bullshit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMale fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it&rsquo;s all a male fantasy&hellip; Even pretending you aren&rsquo;t catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you&rsquo;re unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are your own voyeur.‚Äù
(Margaret Atwood)</p>
<p>Do you get it. Fetisization. When I‚Äôm feeling stuck in what one might call a rocky bottom that&rsquo;s so bad it&rsquo;s almost good-like feeling good is so foreign you dont remember it- or like a distant estimation of yourself because asian, female, sex work, and violence made the news again, the actor cowers. One sentence that spans your whole life: your social identifiers to mask what you&rsquo;ve endured. Vision becomes peering, the horizon blinding and yet the actress who knows what she wants, of course, comes in waves. When I‚Äôm feeling coastal and bobbing I‚Äôll be workin on my PT to say fuck saving a relationship, this is for my own pleasure and sex can be whatever i want against the exclusionary grain. And that&rsquo;s on birds and the bees. Buzz buzz bitchhhh. Nature.</p>
<p>Nurture. How do i fancy looking after a seven year old petri dish? Frankly I&rsquo;m terrified;  I can see you wiggling and writhing into new scary shapes that amount to signs of the time. But, mostly, the signs of your parents' times, so I wince that there&rsquo;s no avoiding the fall to archetypes. In just one body you have the power to bully, to get your way, and poison a forest as everyone we know excuses you. To think you could be the villian, the person who hurts someone enough to cause the pain that defines them. But in the same story, you&rsquo;re the victim, unable to catch you breath. We adults live fantastically disembodied lives and play the most chilling games of restraint, especially boys turning their double digits. You&rsquo;re still a child, and the world of hurt arriving may someday define you.</p>
<p>In hope, you&rsquo;re still a child. Among your high school class of 2031 there you must have a friend who is able to breathe a deep breath for the stethoscope without &lsquo;honey could you try that again? into your belly this time.&rsquo; Gender as performance is common core, not a &lsquo;woke&rsquo; person&rsquo;s chore to teach someone with equivalent access to education and internet. Your trans friends can walk you down the street or line to stage at graduation without fearing for their lives. Maybe you are trans and safe. Say there&rsquo;s the girl from bio who you kinda know, whose hips are filled with air, who by the time she enters college has already torn down the belief that intimacy is sex is one-sided function of poison evaporating you into the wall so you no longer exist. If hope is at least half as real as spray cheese, there must be the perseverance of the body as love manifested. If there&rsquo;s any hope she&rsquo;s giving the class president speech. Please write back in 2031 even as i cheer in the crowd.</p>
<p>Coming to terms with my body is gaining the ability to love, as the performance of love and the body alienate me from the very things themselves. But i perform for the wrong people, or rather the faulty, fragile matrices of concepts I project onto people. In the past year I learned love doesn‚Äôt just come built into the body. I have to make the choice in opposition to the dominant fantasy which is what‚Äôs poisonous, not the people who care for me and give me their world. The amorphous list to include me.</p>
<p>I remind you to think on your list as you start to form sentences on the world in which you live, the world you are creating in every moment which is more inclusive, open, and ever more loving than mine.</p>
<p>This year I took after your bravery to let yourself feel. Before this year, I‚Äôve never ever cried for those special souls who are still close, meeting the same moments as me. For those lucky stars still in my life. With love I&rsquo;m dizzy as fuck. I need to sit down in the shower. Everywhere I go my existence is absolutely connected to every other person exchanging from receptacles for dopamine or good grief or awful horrid senseless, godless grief, and these threads never cease. Love yourself, whoever else and yourself all at once, for love cannot thrive in a silo.</p>
<p>For love cannot thrive in a silo, I invite you to push back on the logic to wait till you&rsquo;re &lsquo;fully healed&rsquo; to extend love, because that benchmark isn&rsquo;t real. Love yourself before anyone else is as much of a lie as love yourself last, i feel. At least when i believe i come first/last i believe the fear of getting better gets the better of me. I think maybe when the cruelty of this world is stranger to none, the one who&rsquo;s still hurting can even still be kinder: sometimes YOU have to be the pioneer, the healing to your community so deeply in need your very heart and vulnerability become an underground lifeline. Because it&rsquo;s too painful for those before you, and will be for those after. So the seven year old petri dishes can model after and aren&rsquo;t completely screwed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i-love-you">Brother, how do I love you?</h2>
<hr>
<p>At the end of the day, love is an action. A performance. ‚ÄúSomething you work on,‚Äù as my grandpa said. It‚Äôs eye contact, leaning in, breaching the trivial line between ‚Äòlove‚Äô proper and ‚Äòromance‚Äô proper. Something that I understood less and less as I grew up more and more at the onset of this year‚Äôs clarity.</p>
<p>Where do we go when there is nowhere left to go, when there is no longer an ‚Äòoffstage‚Äô and we must grapple with the atrocities we commit against ourselves, our loved ones, our humanity when it is laid bare in front of us and everyone, and our own body, remembers, omnisciently?</p>
<p>How do we love:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform for those who matter. For me, they are the ones who make me better as I better them, in intentional and spontaneous (crucially both) ways. Those who make you feel like you are compromising the least.</li>
<li>Take that medley of method, style sheet of performance and expand on it. Extend it outward without shirking and shrinking away, walk confidently toward that stage (of the social media platform, of the community, of the literal physical stage) and sell it if you need to, but only as much as you need to. When I post anything I primarily imagine the reaction of those true and closest.</li>
<li>Be skeptical of the stage. Be wary of how cynical and wary you are of others‚Äô performance.</li>
<li>Start asking, who are we beyond the things we do? The contemporary spirit says ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to just.. be,‚Äù to ‚Äúdiscover who you are‚Ä¶ really,‚Äù in response and contrast to the interlocking systems that place value in productivity as it relates to one‚Äôs ability to consume. There is this newfound distrust in the act of doing to prove your worth. But‚Ä¶ who am I, really? I.e. when no one else is around, when I am severed from all influence. I don‚Äôt find that this question is worth asking as much as I don‚Äôt believe I have a soul so unlike everyone else‚Äôs, so sad and clever in a hypocritical turn I must uncover myself as an agent of rugged individualism. I think it‚Äôs okay to perform, to like it even, to become who you choose and like who that is, in rewriting our relationship with production and consumption on our own terms&ndash; which the dual advent of self-awareness (as a tool not weapon) and the-universe-at-our-fingertips affords us, for the first time in our humanity.</li>
<li>Love is a performance.</li>
<li>But don‚Äôt forget to keep some for yourself: the self which we don‚Äôt cling to, but instead build up. Everything belongs to the world but it‚Äôs okay to borrow something that makes you feel like home, and then to give it back to the ether a little later. It&rsquo;s okay to have a whatever job. These pieces make up those little moments resembling the illusory residue of ‚Äòself‚Äô which is ugly as only as much as it&rsquo;s incoherent and more appropriately than ugly is fascinating. Navel piercings, painting, a new ideology of double consciousness‚Ä¶ a little faux ‚Äòoffstage‚Äô just for you that you can share or not share with anyone. You can post it or decide you hate it forever, a wee later.</li>
<li>Everyday we have choices to make in a world that is always a stage, regardless if we are formally online or not. Where people are brands of cohesed ideology so attention‚Äôs a scarce commodity and it‚Äôs inevitable or scary but all of this is what makes it possible for us to be more informed-than-ever lovers and collaborators in performance, to propel into existence the kind of world we wish to see, the kind we have not yet seen.</li>
<li>Learn to love the performance and periods where life is your greatest forever romance.</li>
</ol>
<p>If and when i die from being too dramatic, in your letter to me will you say you learned, ‚Äúi have more love than i know what to do with, and now my religion is making creative choices every single day with [whatever my power may be]‚Äù. As his sister making love to creativity i challenge my friend to a mushroom drawing contest. i try to give more than a half assed opinion.. I cannot confirm nor deny i have used my companys self development funds to send my mom AND my friends mom really nice flowers. i carve time to give feedback, not always timely but always surely, for a soliciting friend‚Äôs creative connection, whether it be a beautiful cover on a new guitar, an original song, the script for a podcast, nudes, a dream. Why hold back when you can get over yourself to remember who you forgot to thank; so when you read this you please read it as Love‚Äôs receipt.</p>
