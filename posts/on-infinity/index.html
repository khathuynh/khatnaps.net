				<p><em>I have been fascinated with the idea of ‘small’ and ‘big’ infinities for awhile. in my freshman year seminar filtering the intersection of physics, astronomy, philosophy, and religion, i went to musing a bit on the subject..</em></p>
<p>Some people are lucky enough to have a singular, wholly defining experience with the idea of spatial infinity. They describe a stand-alone night of stargazing, a life-changing explanation by a teacher, or a wide-eyed gaze under the glowing shell of a planetarium. As wondrous as it sounds, I am not one of those people. I cannot recall the first time I truly realized the expanse of the universe and the grandiose of the objects within it, although slowly overtime, I have come to accept those notions as fact. Instead, I have grappled with the concept of infinity through a different, and in my opinion, more fathomable perspective—a mathematical one.</p>
<p>At various points in elementary school, I would catch myself questioning the limits of numbers. The first grade activity of writing numbers one to 100 on a long roll of paper for the 100th day of school got the gears grinding, as I was sure the list could go on to one million, billion, trillion, zillion, and eventually forever. Sometime later, after being introduced to decimals, I started to view “forever” differently. “Forever” could surely relate to something numerically large, but could also suggest a never-ending pattern within a small space. One-third in decimal form, or 1.33 with the line over the three, was a recycled illustration of this through my earlier academic years.</p>
<p>Then came the joint effect of John Green’s bestseller novel The Fault in Our Stars and high school precalculus. “Some infinities are bigger than other infinities,” Green states, a standout line in an otherwise mediocre piece of YA fiction. I tried to comprehend one of Green’s visualizing examples: the list of all numbers (rational and irrational) between 0 and 1 versus a list of all numbers between 0 and 2 are indeed both infinite, but is there a possibility that the second list holds a larger infinity than the first list? By looking at the infinite end behaviors of various graphs in precalc, I concluded that some functions exhibit a faster rate of approaching infinity than others, creating the Green illusion of infinity itself having size. I started to move on from scribbled numbers on a page, yearning to think larger and grander. With a foundation built from investigations with numerical infinity, I was ready to gage the limitlessness of the actual world around me. I wanted to turn Green’s fiction into fact.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">Section 1</h2>
<p>Far from the “eureka moments” described earlier, my interaction with mathematical and spatial infinity has been a slow, evolving journey of discovery and growth. Nevertheless, my unique realization process has forged a path towards a cosmic perspective that I can truly call my own. In having experimented with tangible objects like numbers and graphs, I’m more able to ‘accept’ the infinitude of an imperceptible universe over time. I’d like to say I’m stil perplexed or frustrated by the distance between Earth and stars or even the possibility of life on an infinite number of planets. But it’s okay. I look at the night sky and I feel at ease; each experienced moment in passing is, after all, a small infinity in itself.
