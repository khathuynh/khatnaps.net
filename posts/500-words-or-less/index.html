				<p><em>Carleton is powered by wind turbines. What empowers you?</em></p>
<p>Often the realization comes to me that every person I’ve ever seen has a life to live, vivid and complex as my own, populated with his or her ambitions, friends, routines, and worries. There is a word for this, and it was made up by some guy on a blog. However, that expressed technicality doesn’t bother me. “Sonder” permeates my reality, and to me, the word is as real as real gets.</p>
<p>Since I was young, I have been fascinated with people, especially strangers. I love strangers. I focus in on the business suit man on Boston’s Orange Line and wonder what stop he will get off at. What will his meeting be about and are there butterflies in his stomach concerning it? On a flight, I predict what complimentary drink my row partner will order. Is she a coffee-rush kind of gal or a more bare-bones water type? I hope that I will get the opportunity to dive into an eye-opening conversation with her later.</p>
<p>Above all else, I yearn for a magical sense of connectedness within a world of difference. I am hyper-aware of the potentials of others and the potential of myself, and of the crazy kick start reaction spark that could happen if the primer and latter were combined. On the train, I know I could learn so much from just starting a conversation with the other teen leaning against the metal pole. We could go deeper than just small talk about the latest young adult dystopian novel-gone-film. If I’m lucky, he will tell me about his passions, experiences, and where he is going, while I tell him about my love of free verse poetry, my first crush, and an imminent permit test. If I’m lucky, I’ll be consumed by an exchange of ideas more precious than crystals of Parmesan cheese.</p>
<p>So what empowers me? As a scholar, I am driven by the pursuit of knowledge and the potentials of knowledge to alleviate the human condition. As one individual stuck in a web of six degree separations, I’ll make the list short. The ability to provoke thought in others. A sense of mutual understanding. Empathy. Sonder. Those are the things that I truly crave in life.</p>
