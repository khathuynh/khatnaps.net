				<p><em>My last term at carleton, winter 2019, i took a course called ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Stranger Here Myself.‚Äù in short it‚Äôs a course for kids stuck between cultures and something more. i thought a lot about the challenges and opportunities of vietnamese american identity and hyphenated identities on the whole, centered on a deliberation of my relationship with the vietnamese language‚Äì how can it be that i understand spoken word perfectly, but cant read write or speak for myself ( is it something in my brain or is it the way i was raised). third culturalism, rising to prominence in the u.s., provokes us to ask ourselves these questions. here is my third culture autobiographical.</em></p>

<p>My first language was Vietnamese. For the rules of English lexicon clouding my head, I cannot write in my first language. In reading, I accent the words correctly with no comprehension of meaning. Speaking is a lost cause. Strikingly, then, are the moments in which my family speaks to me in Viet, I comprehend to the extent of responding in English.</p>
<p>The structure of the human brain fundamentally captures the relationship between cognition and language. As I grow older and lose grip on my family tongue, I find solace in connecting my inability to engage code-mixing, code-switching, and diglossia fluidly (multilingual behaviors explored by Laura Ahearn) to untapped neurological function. I am a sponge, a passive observer of the Viet language, now: the three sections of the brain dedicated to reading, thinking, and saying words have blued to dormancy in bolstering activity in the red-hot Wernicke‚Äôs area, which is dedicated solely to reflexive language comprehension of heard words. Referencing the colors of an EEG, this model at once illustrates my loss of constructive ability in Vietnamese; whilst allowing me comfort in knowing that with mental exercise, I can alight cerebral pathways to ‚Äòthink‚Äô back into existence the vestiges of knowledge surrounding my home language.</p>

<h2 id="viet-am-adolescence">Vietnamese-American adolescence: possession of and by a powerful ‚Äòlanguage of wider communication‚Äô</h2>
<hr>
<p>In 2001, I was four and took a long-stay visit to Vietnam with my mom and the rest of our American-side (maternal) family. Adapted to the diasporic circumstances of our greater family tree, its newly formed branches splintered to span the two hemispheres, we made these journeys regularly to bring the halves of the world to meet. At four I remember landing in Saigon, followed by making my first mistake of that trip‚Äîaccepting a Coca Cola can from a total stranger in the airport and my grandma scolding me in consequence. Notably, this cultural infraction did not embarrass me, as such experiences would profoundly distress me later in my adolescence.</p>
<p>I was a sponge of a toddler‚Äîno headspace for cultural humiliation‚Äîabsorbing social recipes within American and Vietnamese contexts mindlessly and at ease. In moments where I posed the foreigner, as when my grandma sternly remarked, ‚ÄúDo NOT take from people you don‚Äôt know, family only!‚Äù I would undertake as authority the cultural rule in question just as swiftly as I had broken it. Weaving through the bookstores of Saigon alongside my Euro-American grandpa, I played a practically convincing native, i.e. gleeful toddler translator between ‚Äùgrandpa Charlie‚Äù and the Vietnamese clerks. The truth is, I was a resilient wanderer, lacking a dominant cultural frame of reference in journeying between Boston and Saigon at regular intervals.</p>
<p>I look back on these early visits to the home country fondly. Sometimes I wish my mind still was a sponge amassing cultural knowledge, each new datapoint correlating perfectly. That I could speak a Vietnamese phrase effortlessly. As I recall the years beyond toddlerhood and into youth, I sense that my adolescent self-identity in that period met difficult battles within a Sch√ºtzian model, exemplified by a feeling I was ashamed to feel: turning more and more a stranger in once familiar cultural spaces and a girl without history (86). I‚Äôd say I rapidly lost touch with first and foremost my home language, then my home culture through these discomforting years‚Äîif I were to emphasize nostalgic vision, a declension narrative.</p>
<p><code>Ultimately, I decide that I don‚Äôt want for the present reduced to reminiscent.</code> In a broad stroke, I will self-constructively engage my childhood experience of being the eldest by twelve years, in all my extended Vietnamese family tree to be born in the States, of being a stranger nowhere and everywhere. My analysis of this intercultural upbringing will be specifically rooted in my ever-changing relationship with the Vietnamese language, as I nuance the adolescent dissolution of my Vietnamese heritage through marginalist and sociolinguistic lenses toward reconciling my mature cultural identity.</p>

<h3 id="elementary">Estrangement: Elementary School</h3>
<hr>
<p>Dedicated to the processes of socializing schoolchildren under the dominant ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù hegemony, the American education system does not spare the intercultural learner. Between fourth and eighth grade, I developed my English language abilities at an exponential rate and at the felt expense of my Vietnamese abilities. Far from a conscious effort, I believe I did so in order to converse with other English-speaking children and excel academically.</p>
<p>Switching between my life at home and school, I could illustrate my view of the world as a ‚Äúdaily life that is not homogenous, and in fact is incoherent and only partially clear,‚Äù as Sch√ºtz applied here describes the fragmented context an individual possesses at the outskirts of a culture (83). In my case, I was figured between American schooling culture and Vietnamese diasporic culture with my internal behavioral codes never wholly relevant in either context. What‚Äôs profound to note, however, is that I once was an accepted member of the latter, minority culture, having demonstrated emic-esque command and confidence in trips abroad and in Viet-American hybrid settings stateside in early elementary school. What happens when an individual, in a subconscious mode, resigns their own in-group knowledge, whilst remaining subjective to fixed cultural expectations posed by both in and out-group audiences?</p>
<p>Sch√ºtz asserts that the third characteristic of a cultural stranger‚Äôs worldview is that it is ‚Äúnot at all free from contradiction‚Äù (83). Contradiction inevitably ensued, like an evil foil to Logic, when I turned double digits. Ultimately a coping mechanism to bridge the gap between self-identity and expectation, I sought to obscure Contradiction by employing Logic: if the world wouldn‚Äôt allow me comfort unconditionally, then I would labor to improve my experience in dominant cultural spaces only, i.e. American school settings.</p>
<p>In one fell swoop, I internalized the ethnocentric gaze (M. Bennett 30). In fourth grade, I wrote my first essay ever on the significance of ‚Äúhome,‚Äù in English. For the year was 2006 and the class near homogenously white, I remember waiting in line to receive feedback from the teacher and overhearing only praise for other students‚Äô lines on ‚Äúthe aroma of chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven‚Äù and ‚Äúof a burning autumn leaf candle.‚Äù The teacher kept telling us to write on ‚Äúaromas,‚Äù the ‚Äúcolors of the hardwood floor,‚Äù and otherwise hypersaturated cuts of the white American bourgeoisie vision. I lived with my mom in a four-room carpeted apartment at basement level with no wonderful aromas to speak of; only the incense that made my eyes cry every time my mom would light them for the Buddha.</p>
<p>Still feeling hindered in school by my multilingual background and thus seeking validation for my English writing labors, I remember changing my essay crafting approach to essentially imitate my classmates in both form and content. I lied about having scented candles! I wrote to please the teacher, to denigrate and render superior, across cultures, in Milton Bennett‚Äôs ethnocentrism frame (37).</p>
<p>As I increasingly exaggerated my adaptation of the stranger role, ‚Äúthinking as usual‚Äù morphed to ‚Äúthinking is always unusual‚Äù‚Äîlosing my original, Viet frame of reference‚Äîfor the value systems my mom and grandparents tried to imprint upon me would continually place me in intercultural and discomforting situations (Sch√ºtz 90). During Sunday youth group meetings at the local Buddhist temple my family attended, I minimally understood the Vinglish (Viet-English) the other youth spoke and saw senselessness in my community involvement. Weekdays after school made for a similarly frustrating experience. My grandma required that in addition to my afternoon, non-school-related English grammar and math exercises, I would have to sharpen my Vietnamese language skills. Recognizing only the utility of grammar and math the American schooling frame, I retaliated childishly whenever my grandma would move us along to the Vietnamese section of afterschool exercises. This marked the start of my relaxing grasp on the ability to write, read, and speak with full comprehension. Here, steeped in my ethnocentric condition, I deeply believed that engaging minority cultural learning would harmfully reform all cognition to unusual and contradictory modes.</p>

<h3 id="junior-high">Terminal Uniqueness: Middle and Early High School</h3>
<hr>
<p>No friend of contradiction, I fell prey to the Janet Bennett‚Äôs encapsulated marginal archetype in my late middle school years. There is no better illustration of my troubled preteen relationship with multiplistic thinking than to continue reflection on my relationship with ethnic Buddhism. As mentioned earlier, my family attended temple services and was (still is) a prominent family of leadership status in the local Boston Buddhist community. That said, I was expected to attend service though after taking a histories of religion course in seventh grade, I truly held a largely secular, grounded, and linear worldview which challenged the spiritualized, circular, and high-context register maintained in Buddhist sermon (class handout on Definition of Cultural Contrasts). Littered with memories of counting wooden ceiling beams to pass time, those Sundays, under the surface, were indication of my shame and self-consciousness in embodying a sort of cultural fraud. For I only understood child‚Äôs speak dialect, having forgone the afterschool Vietnamese lessons in sixth grade, I couldn‚Äôt even comprehend the service wherein temple represented an ethnic rite for the community versus my personal experience of repeated alienation and dissociation (J. Bennett 113).</p>
<p>I met a breaking point where I lied to my mom, insisting I was being bullied in youth group to get out of attending temple. In reality I was embarrassed that all the other youth were more in touch with the culture and spiritual practice than I was. Lying, or otherwise altering others‚Äô perceptions of me, was a habit at which I became very talented.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe encapsulated marginal may report feeling inauthentic all the time, Janet Bennett states, as they ‚Äúfeel detached from all reference groups and [are] forced to resolve conflicts alone (115-116). In early high school, inauthenticity was my mantra. Attempting to assimilate to the demands of the high school cafeteria and social scheme, I radiated pride in response to my classmates‚Äô dominating perception: ‚Äúshe has all white friends so she‚Äôs basically a Twinkie, yellow on the outside and white on the inside!‚Äù Whitewashing, inarguably a catalyst for provoking the captive state of ‚Äúterminal uniqueness,‚Äù victimized me. At activity fairs, I‚Äôd scurry by the Asian club table in hopes that I would not be singled out. Broadly, I‚Äôd perform myself as the ‚Äúcool hipster not-really-Asian‚Äù Asian who everyone was surprised to find really funny ‚Äúonce you get to know her‚Äù and who would kindly avoid any expression of intercultural depth.</p>

<h3 id="high-school">Intercultural Shifting: High School and Beyond</h3>
<hr>
<p>Viewing my behaviors across the American school context and home life (and other diasporic settings) as disjointed whole, it is clear my troubles stem from difficulty in mediating shifts between my two cultures. In my personal language practices, this difficulty is amplified tenfold and speaks to a tangible quality of my incorporation of Janet Bennett‚Äôs loose boundary control in my daily life (115). Language, being so central to my intercultural and diasporic experience, concretizes the problem and remedying solution surrounding my cultural declension narrative.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter‚Äîthe ‚Äúproblem‚Äù‚Äîis that I cannot move fluidly between my two languages. Evidenced in my interactions in Vietnamese, I struggle to free myself from the rules of English grammar and lexicon in every moment of other-cultural construction. For example, I always make (poor, overly conscious) efforts to code-switch with my grandma instead of talking to her in English, but I can never push the envelope even a menial inch toward language mixing. Along Peter Auer‚Äôs typological continuum relating multilingual practices, I remain suspended in behaviors which emphasize ‚Äúthe contrast between one code and the other,‚Äù unable to frame meaning through construction, as interactors of fused lects do (qtd. in Ahearn 132). Any engagement beyond the reflexive mode in Vietnamese (in which I‚Äôm listening to others speak in passive understanding) thus underscores my imposition of English lingual frames across shifting boundary.</p>
<p>To move toward constructive marginality, I seek to hone an awareness ‚Äúsuch that [my] integrated, multicultural existence is maintained, and where conscious, deliberate choice making and management of alternative frames prevail‚Äù (J. Bennett 118). If the problem is a sense of cognitive overdominance exerted by American-English paradigms, then the first step toward the solution is recognizing that I can utilize intentionality and mindfulness to ease transitions across cultural contexts. In college, I‚Äôve turned to peer support groups such as Tim Viet (Viet culture club) and TRIO to celebrate collective attempts to reconnect with home cultures. Together we struggle to nail a pronunciation, or an idiom, and it‚Äôs no longer this big sad moment of failure. Instead it‚Äôs proof I‚Äôm not alone in my desires to explore cultural constructivism, which eases my individual reconciliation process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the decay of my abilities regarding the Vietnamese language in fact poses a personal learning opportunity; for I‚Äôve interpreted for the first time my evolving embodiment of Sch√ºtzian stranger in multilingual contexts as a common intercultural experience. To further provoke a self-constructive vision, I‚Äôve reflected also on the perceptive processes underlying my loss of language: my internalization of contradiction as dissociative and my fixation on boundary control in my personal language practices. Recognition and analysis of these ingrained habits, I believe, is crucial to imagining my transition from an encapsulated marginal identity archetype to constructive marginal. Although, as Ahearn writes, ‚Äúa monolingual perspective is often a consequence of possession of a powerful ‚Äòlanguage of wider communication‚Äô‚Äù and possession by dominant hegemonies, I‚Äôm hopeful that my budding embrace of cultural ambiguity can mitigate the systemic effect (Ahearn 122).</p>
